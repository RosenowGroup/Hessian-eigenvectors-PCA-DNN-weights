# analysis.py
Module that contains functions to manipulate date of TensorFlow models.

# hess.py
Module that contains functions to compute Hessian matrices or eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

# train.py
Module that contains functions to train models.

# programms.ipynb
Notebook that contains small Python programms that are used to obtain the data presented in my Master Thesis.
Each cell corresponds to one programm. Their arguments are given when running the programm, i.e. '''python programm.py -n ResNet'''.

# Network folders
For each desired network, we create one folder with its name plus a python file with the same name.
In this file, the programms can find informations of the network structure, training rules and data set and so on.
See those files to get an insight, what can be contained in those.
The programms will save the network weights, data and plots in those folders for better visibility.
